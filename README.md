# Devred-s_Action_HUD

Howdy, I present here my first (in a long time) mod.

A simple mod that replaces the HUD with something more interactable. Taken a bit from Time Crisis and such games, this mod displays your ammo in a tray that animates any changes in the ammo count. Tossing ammo casings, adding new ammo, and switching trays when switching ammo types are among the ones done here.



I made this mod as a way to practice GZDoom's zscript language, and I ended up cooking something that is best playable with vanilla DOOM or mods that use DOOM's default ammo types. It can still play with other mods that don't use the default ammo types, but it won't display the respective ammo sprites on the tray. Instead, it'll display a generic ammo sprite.

However you choose to play with this mod, I hope it can spice up your game a bit!

-Requires GZDoom 4.12.2 or higher, and a copy of classic DOOM and DOOM II iwads.

-Also if you wish to use this mod or use the code within this mod for your own mods, or make an improved version, you are free to do so. Credit ain't necessary but is much appreciated.
